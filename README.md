This project was developed in 11 days for the course "iPhone Application Design" during the Master degree "Mobile Application Development" at the University of Kent in Canterbury. The full project was implemented in **Swift**, and its outcome is shown in the document `"report.pdf"`.

The goal of this project was to build a complete iOS application, which views dynamic data from an API. The developed app should be able to demonstrate the skills learnt in this module.
Even though it was suggested to use the Flickr.com as an endpoint for the communication to retrieve dynamic data, this project focuses its communication on the Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com).

## üìã The basic requirements for the project were
- Retrieve dynamic data (text and images) from a remote source (Flickr API). i.e. Retrieve a list of the latest photos uploaded to Flickr.
- Present the dynamic data in a table, grid or similar using a UITableView or UICollectionView. i.e. Display thumbnails of latest photos on Flickr in a list with captions.
- Provide navigation between two or more different types of scenes driven by dynamic data. i.e. Tapping on a photo loads a high-resolution version with additional details.

Additionally, extended requirements were implemented. 
**This project was implemented and tested for an iPhone X.**


## ‚≠êÔ∏è Quick Overview
The result of this project is a fully functioning iOS application for iPhoneX, that shows all information stored in the Marvel API - therefore showing every `character`, `comic` and `creator` ever known in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Additionally to exploring the data, the user can save information into his/her favorites, and search for explicit entries. Furthermore, the user can test his/her knowledge by participating in the characters quiz.

The app consists of 4 tabs

- Favs
- Marvel (Comics/Characters/Creators)
- Search
- Quiz

### Favs Tab

As shown in the picture below, the Fav Tab consists of three different sections, that contain the stored `comics`, `characters` and `comics`. The picture also shows the delete functionality and that the user is shown an alert message when he/she wants to see a category that doesn't have any stored values.

### Marvel Tab

The Marvel Tab has a segment with three sections, that controls `comics`, `characters` and `comics` container.

When clicking on one of the cells, the detailsview will show any further details stored in the Marvel API. This example shows the details of "Captain America":

Furthermore, if the user wants is currently in the Detailview of a `comic`, and wants to see its `creatos`, the app will open another Collectionview and then the Detailview of the respective creators. The process can be seen in the next picture. 
Originally it was planned to develop this feature for `characters` and `creators` too, but **unfortunately, because of API restrictions it was not possible**.

### Search

The Search Tab allows the user to search for a keyword by categories (comics`, `characters` and `comics`).

### Quiz

The last tab, the Quiz Tab, allows the user to test his/her knowledge of the MCU characters. The app will randomly display a character, and its and 3 other names. The user has to pick the correct one. If so, the user gets 100 points and the game continues. When the user's answer is not correct, the user gets told which one would have been the right one, and the games ends.
